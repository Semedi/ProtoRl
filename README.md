# ProtoRl

Repository for ProtoRl project.

Basic goal is to create a decent gamedev framework for building Roguelike and Roguelite games using C++.
To achieve this purpose this repository contains the ProtoRl game, a modular game that will use the roguengine framework developed in this same repository.

Knowing this, the project can be separated into two parts:

* Engine framework, under the engine folder and roguengine namespace
* Proper game using the engine (testing and fun)

## COMPILING (WIP)

I recommend compiling the ProtoRl using cmake

```
cd ${ProtoRl_SOURCE}
mkdir build
cmake ..
```
#### Options: 

* BUILD_ENGINE: build the engine shared library.
